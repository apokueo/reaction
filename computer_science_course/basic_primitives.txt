Basic Primitives 

- Turing showed that you can compute anything using 6 primitives 

- modern programming languages have more convenient set of primitives 

- can abstract methods to create new primitives 

- anything computable in one language is computable in any other programming language 
Python, Fortran, Lisp, C, Matlab, Ruby etc
