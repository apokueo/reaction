= is an assignment of a value to a variable name 

pi(variable) = 3.14(value) 

you are saying bind the value 3.14 to the variable pi
and if you ask for the value of pi it will print out 3.14

The value is stored in computer memory (called named table)  
an assignment binds name to value 
retrieve value associated with name or variable by invoking name, by typing pi 

Abstracting Expressions 
why give names to values of expressions? 
reuse names instead of values 
easier to change code later 


pi = 3.14159
radius = 2.2 
area = pi*(radius**2) 
radius = radius + 1
// computes the area 

Names are valuable because they tell you what you are trying to compute or solve 

Changing Bindings 
can rebind variable names using new assignment statements 
previous value may still stored in memory but lost the handle for it
value for area does not change until you tell the computer to do the calculation again

pi = 3.14
radius = 2.2 
area = pi * (radius**2)
radius = radius + 1
