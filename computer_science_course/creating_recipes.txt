Creating Recipes 

- a programming language provides us with a set of primitive operations 

- expressions are complex but legal combinations of primitives in a programming language 

- expressions and computations have values and meanings in a programming language 


Aspects of Languages 

- primitive constructs 
	- English Words: 
		- programming language: numbers, strings, simple operators 

	- float, booleans, integers, strings


Syntax 
	'parsing of a sentence to check whether a sentence is legal or syntactically valid' - 
		the same happens in computer programming 

		Ex. "cat dog boy" -> not syntactically valid 
		    "cat hugs boy" -> syntactically valid 

		Ex. Programming Language 
			"hi"5 => not syntactially valid 
			3.2*5 => syntactically valid because it consists Num+operator+Num

			Good programming - How to put together syntatically valid sequences


Static Semantics -> is which syntatically valid strings have meaning 

English: "I am hungry" => valid but static semantic in error

Programming Language: 3.2*5 - syn valid 
			3 + "hi" static semantic error because 2 different primitives and they aren't expressions we want to assign meaning to

Semantics is the meaning associated with a syntatically correct string of symbols with no semantic errors 

English: can have many meanings -
	- Flying planes can be dangerous 
	- This reading lamp hasn't uttered a word since I bought it

	programming languages: have only one meaning but may not be what a programmer intended (BUGS)
