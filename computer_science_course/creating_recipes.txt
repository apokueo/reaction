Creating Recipes 

- a programming language provides us with a set of primitive operations 

- expressions are complex but legal combinations of primitives in a programming language 

- expressions and computations have values and meanings in a programming language 


Aspects of Languages 

- primitive constructs 
	- English Words: 
		- programming language: numbers, strings, simple operators 

	- float, booleans, integers, strings


Syntax 
	'parsing of a sentence to check whether a sentence is legal or syntactically valid' - 
		the same happens in computer programming 

		Ex. "cat dog boy" -> not syntactically valid 
		    "cat hugs boy" -> syntactically valid 

		Ex. Programming Language 
			"hi"5 => not syntactially valid 
			3.2*5 => syntactically valid because it consists Num+operator+Num

			Good programming - How to put together syntatically valid sequences


Static Semantics -> is which syntatically valid strings have meaning 

English: "I am hungry" => valid but static semantic in error

Programming Language: 3.2*5 - syn valid 
			3 + "hi" static semantic error because 2 different primitives and they aren't expressions we want to assign meaning to

Semantics is the meaning associated with a syntatically correct string of symbols with no semantic errors 

English: can have many meanings -
	- Flying planes can be dangerous 
	- This reading lamp hasn't uttered a word since I bought it

	programming languages: have only one meaning but may not be what a programmer intended (BUGS) 


Where things go wrong 

	1. Syntactic Errors - common and easily caught : you wrote something illegally 
	
	2. Static semantic erros - some languages check for these before running program 
		can cause unpredictable behavior - you wrote something that is valid but made no sense in the order that you arranged it in
		* there are languages that will check this before it runs (javascript) but some that check it on the fly (python)

	3. No semantic errors but different meaning than what programmer intended
		program crashes, stops running
		program runs forever
		program gives an answer but different than expected 


The Goal 
- Learn the syntax and semantics of a programming language 
- Learn how to use those elements to translate "recipes" for solving problem into a form that the computer can use to do work for us 
- Learn computational modes of thought to enable us to leverage a suite of methods that solve complex problems
