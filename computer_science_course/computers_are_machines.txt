Computers are machines 

How to capture a recipe in a mechanical process? 

Fix program: 
	computer 
		calculator
		Alan Turing's Bombe (designed to break Germany's encryption) 
	

Stored Program:
	computer 
		machine stores and executes instructions 



Basic Machine Architecture 

Memory (place to store things - data/or sequences of instructions that are programs - mechanical state) 

Arithmetic logic unit -> do primitive ops (addition, subtraction, division, multiplication)
	Control Unit -> program counter -> points to location of first instruction into memory. 
	Will return a boolean 
to 

	Input / Output o


Programs are sequences of instructions


function calculate() { 
	for (var i; i < 10; i++) {
		console.log(i); 

	} 
calculator();  


Stored Program Computer 

- sequence of instructions stored inside computer
	- built from 'predefined' set of primitive instructions 
 	1. arithmetic and logic 
	2. simple tests
	3. moving data

- special program (interpreter) executes each instruction in order 
	- use tests to change flow of control through sequence 
	- stop when done
