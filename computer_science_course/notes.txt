Startup Science - 

What have I learned? 
	From my research, startups fail because they are not innovative or they are rehashes of 'others' 
	vision. Hence, why I am employing computer science to supplement the vision that I have. 


Topics:
Thinking Computationally 

- represent Knowlege with 'data structures' 
- iteration and recursion as computational metaphors 
- abstraction of procedures and data types 
- organize and modularize systems using object classes and methods
- different classes of algorithms, searching and sorting 
- complexity of algorithms 



Larry, what does a computer do? 

	Fundamentally
		- perform calculations
		- a billion calculations per second!
		- remembers results (100s of gigabytes of storage) 
	
	What kinds of calculations? 
		- built in to the language 
		- ones that you define as a programmer 


Are there limits? 

	- Despite its speed and size, a computer does have limitations 
		- Some problems still too complex 
			(Accurate weather prediction at a local scale) 
		- Cracking encrpytion schemes
	
	- Some problems are fundamentally impossible to compute 
		- Predicting whether a peice of code will always yeild or halt an answer
