String, Branching and Iteration 



Bindings

Variables - called Bindings

name {descriptive, meaningful, helps us re-read code easily, cannot be keywords}

value {information stored, can be updated}


x = 1 
y = 2
y = x
x = y


Strings (expression) 

It is a sequence of characters, letters, special characters, spaces, digits 
enclosed in single/double quotes 


foo = "this isn't right" 

x = 3 
ans = 0

itersLeft = x 
while(itersLeft != 0):
	ans = ans + x
	itersLeft = itersLeft - 1 
print(str(x) + '*' + str(x) + ' = ' + str(ans)) 

Type tells the operator what to do with objects 

Strings are non-scalar!!!!!!! Ex. 'Marcus'[0] 
				you can't do that with 4455[0]
